        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Savannah Deseo Ortiz, I'm 20 years old, and I currently am majoring in plant biology. By working in botany, I will be studying what plants are made up of, and how they can aid us in many ways. An aspect of professional botany involves getting out into the field and getting hands-on experience with plants in a natural environment. These environments can range from greenhouses and gardens to forests and meadows. Iâ€™ve been to a nearby forest and investigated its flora, identifying plants beneficial to humans and those simply helping the environment or local fauna. 
<br><br>

        Thereâ€™s also the place in greenhouses, cultivating plants just right and making sure they grow as efficiently as possible. Making sure the plants get the correct amount of water and nutrients, making sure theyâ€™re planted in the correct soil, and measuring humidity are other parts of the job. Additionally, someone like me can find themselves looking at plants on a microscopic level, seeing how they grow and develop over time, as well as how theyâ€™re made up chemically. Some plants must be carefully watched and taken care of, as they can be fragile and decay quickly. 
<br><br>

       In addition, we will spend considerable time in laboratories, where we conduct experiments, analyze data, and study plant samples. These controlled environments enable detailed investigation into plant anatomy, physiology, genetics, and biochemistry. Through techniques such as DNA sequencing, electron microscopy, and biochemical assays, we uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. This can help us transform plant life into things like medicine and the like.
<br><br>
Botanical research often intersects with other scientific disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. Botanists may work alongside ecologists, geneticists, climatologists, and conservation biologists to address complex questions about plant biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics, and environmental sustainability. Such collaborations facilitate a holistic approach to understanding the intricate relationships between plants, organisms, and their environments.

<br><br>
Beyond research, botanists play crucial roles in conservation and resource management. By assessing plant populations, monitoring threatened species, and identifying invasive species, botanists contribute to biodiversity conservation efforts and ecosystem restoration projects. Their expertise also informs land-use planning, agricultural practices, and policy decisions aimed at preserving natural habitats and mitigating human impacts on the environment.

Communicating scientific findings to diverse audiences is another essential aspect of a botanist's work. Whether publishing research papers, delivering presentations at conferences, or engaging with the public through outreach programs, botanists serve as ambassadors for plant science. By sharing their knowledge and enthusiasm for plants, we inspire others to appreciate the plant kingdom's beauty and importance and become stewards of the natural world.
<br><br>

My experience in botany offers a multifaceted journey of exploration, discovery, and stewardship. From the thrill of field expeditions to the rigors of laboratory research, botanists like me play a vital role in advancing our understanding of plants and their ecosystems while advocating for their conservation and sustainable use. In a world facing increasing environmental challenges, the expertise and passion of botanists are more crucial than ever in safeguarding the diversity and resilience of plant life on Earth.
